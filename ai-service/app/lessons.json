        "content": "Fundamental analysis is the process of evaluating a company’s financial health, business model, and future potential to determine its true value. Unlike technical analysis, which focuses on stock price movements and charts, fundamental analysis focuses on the company itself — its profits, assets, management, and growth prospects."

        "title": "Why Analyze Companies?",
        "content": "Over time, a company’s stock price tends to follow its financial performance. When profits rise consistently, investor confidence grows, pushing the price higher. Conversely, poor results often lead to falling prices."

        "content": "Fundamental analysis has two parts: qualitative (the non-numerical aspects like management quality, business model, and brand strength) and quantitative (numbers like revenue, profit, ratios, and valuation). Both together give a complete view of the company."

        "content": "The income statement (also called the Profit & Loss statement) shows performance over a period — usually a quarter or a year.It answers: *Did the company make a profit? Key elements: Revenue (Sales)** – total money earned from goods/services. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** – direct costs of producing goods. Gross Profit = Revenue − COGS. Operating Expenses** – salaries, rent, marketing, admin. Operating Profit (EBIT) = Gross Profit − Operating Expenses Net Income = Operating Profit − Interest − Taxes. High profits signal efficiency; falling profits warn of cost or demand issues."

The cash flow statement groups movements into: 1. **Operating Activities** – cash from core business (sales − payments). 2. **Investing Activities** – buying/selling assets or investments. 3. **Financing Activities** – loans, dividends, share issues. **Free Cash Flow (FCF)** = Operating Cash Flow − Capital Expenditure. It shows cash left for dividends, debt repayment, or reinvestment."

The final cash balance from Cash Flow appears under **Assets → Cash** on the Balance Sheet. This linkage ensures accounting consistency — every profit or expense eventually affects cash or equity."

Key ratios taught here: 1) Gross Margin = (Revenue − Cost of Goods Sold) ÷ Revenue. • What it tells you: How much profit is left after direct costs of making the product/service. • Simple view: Higher gross margin ⇒ better basic product economics. 2) Operating Margin = Operating Profit (EBIT) ÷ Revenue. • What it tells you: Profitability after operating costs (salaries, rent, marketing) but before interest and taxes. • Simple view: Shows core business efficiency. 3) ROE (Return on Equity) = Net Income ÷ Shareholders’ Equity. • What it tells you: How effectively the company uses owners’ money to generate profit. • Simple view: Higher ROE (sustainably) ⇒ management is using equity efficiently. 4) ROA (Return on Assets) = Net Income ÷ Total Assets. • What it tells you: How efficiently the company uses all assets to generate profit. • Simple view: Useful when comparing asset-heavy vs. asset-light businesses."

Higher D/E ⇒ more debt relative to equity. • Simple view: Too much debt can increase risk during downturns. 2) Interest Coverage Ratio = EBIT ÷ Interest Expense. • What it tells you: How comfortably a company can pay interest out of operating profit. • Rule of thumb: Above ~3× is generally comfortable (varies by industry/cycle)."

Value (often called intrinsic value) is what the business is actually worth based on earnings power, assets, and future potential. A share can be: • **Undervalued** → Market price below intrinsic value → possible buy. • **Overvalued** → Market price above intrinsic value → caution or sell. Warren Buffett’s rule: *“Price is what you pay; value is what you get.”* Short-term price = opinion; long-term value = fundamentals."

Price-to-Book (P/B)** = Share Price ÷ Book Value per Share. • Book Value ≈ Net assets (assets − liabilities). • Useful for asset-heavy businesses like banks. **3. Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA)** = (Market Cap + Debt − Cash) ÷ EBITDA. • Compares total business value to operating profit. • Preferred when companies have different debt levels."

Choose a discount rate (usually the required rate of return or WACC). 3. Discount each year’s FCF to present value using PV = FCF ÷ (1 + r)^n. 4. Add up all PV + Terminal Value → Intrinsic Value. If this value > market price → stock may be undervalued."

They influence company performance, investor confidence, and stock prices. **Main Indicators:** • **GDP (Gross Domestic Product):** Total value of goods and services produced. High GDP growth → strong economy → higher corporate earnings. • **Inflation:** Measures how fast prices of goods and services are rising. Moderate inflation (2–5%) is healthy; too high reduces purchasing power. • **Interest Rates:** Set by central banks (e.g., RBI). Higher rates make loans expensive, slowing spending and growth; lower rates boost borrowing and investment."

For example, if value = ₹500 and price = ₹400, Margin = (500−400)/500 = 20%."
